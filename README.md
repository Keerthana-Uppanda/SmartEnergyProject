# 🔌 Smart Energy Consumption Analysis — House 1 (REFIT Dataset)

This project focuses on **device-level energy consumption analysis and forecasting** using the **REFIT Smart Home Dataset (House 1)**.
The work covers the **complete pipeline from raw data to baseline machine learning model**.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

* Analyze household energy consumption at appliance level
* Clean and preprocess large-scale time-series data
* Engineer meaningful features for forecasting
* Build and evaluate a **baseline Linear Regression model**
* Prepare the project for advanced time-series models (LSTM)

## 🧹 Module 1 & 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### Performed Tasks

* Loaded REFIT House 1 dataset (~6.9M rows)
* Checked and confirmed:

  * No missing values
  * No duplicate records
* Renamed appliance columns to real appliance names
* Identified outliers (retained as valid high-energy events)
* Converted timestamps to `datetime`
* Set time as index
* Created `active_count` feature
* Filtered rows with **active_count ≥ 3**
* Resampled data:

  * Hourly
  * Daily
* Normalized features using **Min-Max Scaling**
* Split dataset into:

  * Training (70%)
  * Validation (15%)
  * Testing (15%)

## 📊 Module 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Analysis Included

* Summary statistics
* Distribution plots of:

  * Aggregate load
  * Individual appliances
* Boxplots for outlier inspection
* Correlation heatmap:

  * Relationship between appliances and aggregate consumption

All tables and visualizations are included directly inside the notebook.

## 🧠 Module 3: Feature Engineering

### Features Created

* **Time-based features**

  * Hour
  * Day
  * Weekday
  * Month
* **Device-level aggregation**

  * Total appliance load
  * Mean appliance load
  * Maximum appliance load
* **Lag features**

  * Previous hour (`lag1`)
  * Previous day (`lag24`)
* **Rolling statistics**

  * 3-hour rolling mean
  * 24-hour rolling mean
* Handled NaN values generated by lag/rolling operations
* Prepared final ML-ready feature matrix

Final dataset:

* **3702 samples**
* **21 engineered features**
* **1 target variable (Aggregate energy)**

## 📈 Module 4: Baseline Model Development

### Model Implemented

* **Linear Regression** as baseline forecasting model

### Evaluation Metrics

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Metrics computed for:

  * Training set
  * Validation set
  * Test set

### Visualizations

* Actual vs Predicted energy usage (line plot)
* Scatter plot of actual vs predicted values

The baseline model serves as a **reference point for comparison with advanced models**.
